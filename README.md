# Roll a Ball with Unity!

I followed a Unity tutorial to create a single player game where the goal is to roll
a ball and pick up all the little yellow gems to win. I also added to the tutorial by creating
red cylinder obstacles. If the ball hits the obstacles then the player loses.

This was my first time using Unity, so everything was new. I learned the basics of using the 
Unity platform, and also dipped my feet into coding with C#. 

The game functions properly. I'm still working on getting accustomed to the platform and still trying 
to wrap my mind around how everything ties together.
